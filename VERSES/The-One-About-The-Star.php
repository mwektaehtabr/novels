        <p>When he was one, he was sitting on a couch by a television when a clown with melting makeup appeared cackling on the screen.</p>
        <p>When he was two, he was sitting in a seat at a cineplex when a jester with jingling bells appeared weeping on the screen.</p>
        <p>When he was four, he was sitting in the audience at a theater when a magician burst into flames on the stage.</p>
        <p>When he was eight, a cosmetologist trimmed his hair in a style that his parents considered too short, and later that day he was sipping on a vanilla milkshake at a picnic table at an apple orchard when a stranger in a magenta suit approached his parents, smiling, waving, explaining that she was an agent scouting for a project that would be filming in the state later that summer.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have just the perfect vibe for the role,&rdquo; the agent said, gushing.</p>
        <p>Afterward, back at the house, sitting in the grass beneath the massive oak tree in the yard, his parents talked with him about the idea.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you want to go,&rdquo; his mother said.</p> 
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Only if you want,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d have a chance,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>William thought for a moment.</p>
        <p>A breeze blew through the leaves of the oak tree.</p> 
        <p>A hummingbird was flitting around the branches.</p> 
        <p>The trunk of the oak tree creaked in the wind.</p>
        <p>He had never imagined being an actor.</p>
        <p>But secretly he wanted to be famous.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the audition,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>Sixty-four years later he stood in the darkness in the starlight on the glass patio of an ultramodern mansion, silver hair slicked with mousse, face creased with wrinkles, jaw rough with silver stubble, throat scented with cologne, dressed in a silk robe a shade of ivory, gripping a porcelain cup of genmaicha. Hollywood glittering neon below the mansion from the hills to the sea. He gazed down at the city, trembling with despair. Thinking. Why are you here. Who are you here. Industry of make-believe. A make-believe industry. Every other city in the world was devoted to useful industries. Creating futons, jackets, soaps, dishes, automobiles, computers, binoculars, megaphones, sledgehammers, tractors, wheelchairs, bathtubs, ovens, paperclips, elevators, spaceships. What was created here. Only mirages. Fantasies. Illusions. He was a global icon. The most beloved actor of a generation. Had played some of the greatest roles of the century. The role of a chess prodigy, overwhelmed by the social dynamics at school. The role of a graffiti artist, reprimanded for skipping class to vandalize restrooms. The role of a lonely hacker, exploring a government database despite the inherent danger. The role of a teenage prostitute, dreaming of visiting the ocean. The role of a pop singer, diagnosed with cancer on a world tour. The role of a bohemian freighthopper, brimming with youthful goodwill toward humanity. The role of a patriotic soldier, traumatized by the atrocities of war. The role of a college dropout, happily employed at a karaoke club. The role of a pothead cashier, robbed at gunpoint over a misunderstanding. The role of a rollerblading bartender, accused of murder as a prank. The role of an environmental activist, sneaking into a slaughterhouse undercover. The role of a daredevil medic, speeding an ambulance between neighborhoods during a pandemic. The role of a libertine banker, sentenced to serve meals at a homeless shelter as punishment for stealing a ferry while tripping on acid. The role of a religious radical, plotting to commit an act of terrorism at a parade. The role of a brutal dictator, exulting in bloodshed at an extravagant party. The role of a cult leader, descending into madness in a rainforest. The role of a political prisoner, enduring torture with an unbreakable spirit. The role of a philosophy professor, inspired by a chance encounter at a diner. The role of a fashion designer, tempted by a forbidden love. The role of a gritty miner, trapped in a collapsed tunnel on a holiday. The role of a cheerful plumber, hired to recover a lost engagement ring. The role of an angry trucker, determined to avenge a hijacked fireworks shipment. The role of a fragile librarian, timidly spreading kindness through the community. The role of a hardboiled detective, betrayed during a raid on a warehouse. The role of a respected rancher, struggling to control an addiction to liquor. The role of a tech mogul, investigating the origins of a brilliant patent. The role of an embattled president, distracted by a newfound enthusiasm for ballet. The role of a distinguished physicist, desperate to conceal a horrible discovery. The role of a traveling gambler, chasing riches with a quirky charm. The role of a wandering monk, seeking atonement for a mysterious crime. The role of an obscure poet, frightened by what may be signs of dementia. The role of a grizzled astronaut, embarking on a mission to explore another galaxy. A career of pretending. Why was he so beloved. Why did humanity feel such an intense admiration for him. Because humanity had watched him pretend to be people living profound lives. He was admired for pretending to be people who had lived profound lives. In reality, he had lived basically no life whatsoever. Orphaned decades ago. Divorced by a model who had tried and failed to understand him. Divorced by a comedian who had tried and failed to understand him. Parent to seven children who rarely contacted him. Had never been home, had always been working, when the kids had been young. Devoted to acting. And for what. Why had he devoted so much of life to acting. Any other pursuit in life was an identity. The identity of a teacher was a teacher. The identity of a chef was a chef. The identity of a lawyer was a lawyer. The identity of a doctor was a doctor. The identity of a gardener was a gardener. The identity of a mechanic was a mechanic. The identity of a janitor was a janitor. The identity of a skateboarder was a skateboarder. But what was the identity of an actor. An actor was the absence of all identity. Never a person, only a persona. Oscars. Emmys. Tonys. Blank-faced statues gleaming on a wooden shelf in the parlor of the mansion behind him. Unholy bodhisattvas. For decades he had been haunted by a sense that acting was pointless. He&rsquo;d been a child when he&rsquo;d first begun to wonder, on the day that the shoot had ended for what would be a breakout role, and with every role that he&rsquo;d played since he&rsquo;d only become increasingly convinced. And still, even as the feeling had consumed him, he had continued to act. Performing at a relentless pace. For what purpose. Why are you here. Who are you here. He&rsquo;d accomplished nothing in life. The moon had risen. Crickets chirped. Frogs warbled. He could smell the cedar trees as he breathed. He drank a sip of genmaicha, eyes shimmering with tears, and then, grimacing, blinking, glancing back toward the mansion, he noticed the blank-faced statues gleaming on the wooden shelf in the parlor, and he froze, frowning, suddenly thinking of a magazine article that he&rsquo;d once read about the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. According to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, at any given instant spacetime was branching into an infinite number of parallel universes. Every life that possibly could be lived would be lived. Every possible life. When he&rsquo;d first read about the idea, he hadn&rsquo;t realized that there were any personal implications, but he realized now that there were personal implications. Scientifically, observation of the parallel universes was impossible. No data could be gathered directly. But could data be gathered indirectly. Observation of the parallel universes was possible, he suddenly recognized, artistically. In an infinite number of parallel universes, there was nothing fake about the roles that he&rsquo;d played. None of those roles had been fiction. All of those roles had been nonfiction. Actual lives. First take, second take, third take, fourth take, every variation a reality somewhere. Summoning scenes from those universes to here. He became aware that he had goosebumps. Adrenaline pumping. Bursting excitement. He had never thought about acting like this before. How had he never realized until now. For years he&rsquo;d hated the sight of those blank-faced statues, symbols of a pointless occupation, but looking at those blank-faced statues again now, he saw symbols of a noble purpose. He had achieved something in life. He had conjured beings from hundreds of parallel universes. Multi-limbed avatar. He was glowing. Glancing back at the glittering neon below the mansion, he laughed with wonder. What a marvelous city. Daring. Intrepid. Heroic. For over a century now, creating portals across the multiverse.</p>
        <p>He stood there thinking until dawn, watching the sky lighten from violet to indigo then cyan, and then when he noticed the goldfinches chirping he decided that he should go to bed, but as he was shuffling along the pool toward the doors to the mansion he realized that he felt dizzy, that vision was blurring in an eye, that an arm had stiffened, that a leg was dragging, and he staggered to a halt, bewildered. The silk robe rippled with a breeze. Through the confusion he became aware that he was maybe having a stroke. The porcelain cup dropped with a shatter. Then the goldfinches fluttered away and he lurched and he stumbled and he flopped sideways through the air, grunting at a jolt of pain as his head struck the railing along the ladder.</p>
        <p>He tumbled into the pool with a splash.</p>
        <p>Shock of frigid water.</p>
        <p>Bright flashes of sunshine.</p>
        <p>Twisting swirls of blood.</p>
        <p>As he sank in the pool, feebly stretching an hand toward the surface, frantically kicking a foot in the depths, with a sense of astonishment he suddenly realized that he&rsquo;d been acting for so many years that to him even death felt like a performance. But he was delighted, for once, to be performing a scene from this universe. Here.</p>
