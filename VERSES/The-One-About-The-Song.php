        <?php include "2.php";?> Turning toward his bed with the book, he could hear the muffled howl of the wind in the yard and the faint murmur of an advertisement on the radio, and then there was a tremendous snap and a crash and he got slammed to the floor.</p>
        <p>Flashes of sunlight. Dazzling stars in his vision. He became aware that he was gasping for air. With a sense of confusion, he realized that acorns were scattered across the carpet next to him. Broken shingles. Smashed plaster. Turning toward the ceiling, he saw the rough bark of a trunk spotted with lichen, leaves translucent with golden sunlight, the bright blue of the sky beyond a hole in the roof, and he realized that a tree had fallen onto the house, and that he couldn&rsquo;t move, and that he couldn&rsquo;t feel, and then he looked down and saw that he had been impaled through the chest by a branch of the tree and that his t-shirt was already drenched with blood. His parents appeared above him in a panic, and then his father hurried away to call for an ambulance as his mother knelt over him with an expression of horror. A sparrow landed on a branch above him but made no noise. His final sensations were the sound of the wind and the sound of the leaves and the sight of his mother crying over him, stroking his face with a hand. He suddenly thought of the sheet music on the piano. The unfinished song.</p>
