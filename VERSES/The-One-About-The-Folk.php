        <?php include "0.php";?> and later that year the child was born, in a busy urban hospital on the sunny autumn morning of November 6, 1985. If he&rsquo;d been a girl, his parents would have named him Megan, but instead his parents named him William.</p>
        <p>When he was two his mother died of influenza and when he was three his father applied for a job as a federal agent and when he was four his father married a pharmacist and a sister was born during a rainstorm and dandelions bloomed and milkweed flowered and a tornado destroyed the library downtown and when he was sixteen he found a guitar in a dumpster and with money from a job at a diner he bought some strings for the guitar, twisting the pegs on the guitar to tighten the strings by the light of a lamp in a bedroom with walls painted pink.</p>
        <p>His father begged him to go to college, so he applied, and he enrolled, but he only attended for a week before dropping out to record an album.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Will said.</p>
        <p>His father was too distressed to speak.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I just,&rdquo; Will said.</p>
        <p>A breeze blew through the leaves of the beech trees beyond the windows.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I need to do this,&rdquo; Will said.</p>
        <p>He recorded the album. Landed a record deal with an indie label. His father bought a hundred copies, but otherwise in that first year the album hardly sold. The critical reviews were rave, hailing the album as a new genre of folk. Quarkpunk. He was broke. He was determined. He lived in a van, touring to promote the album. Louisville. Nashville. Memphis. Birmingham. Atlanta. Charlotte. Savannah. Charleston. Jacksonville. Houston. Dallas. Austin. Showering in gyms. Washing clothing in sinks. Drying clothing on hangers. Surviving on bread, apples, cheddar, peanut butter spooned straight from the jar. Drinking water from a canteen. Coffee from a styrofoam cup. Bourbon from a plastic mug. Sewing ripped clothing with tattooed hands. Lonely. Working on songs for a new album between shows.</p>
        <p>One night after a show he hooked up with a fan.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna be famous someday,&rdquo; Roxanne said.</p>
        <p>As she drifted off to sleep, lying there naked in the flickering light of a candle, he suddenly thought of some lyrics for a verse. He realized that he needed to start driving soon. Phoenix. Tomorrow a show at a bar. Roxanne was twitching at a dream. He wanted to kiss her goodbye. He wrote her a note instead. He got dressed. Baggy flannel. Skinny jeans. Combat boots. He drank a sip of water from the faucet. Then he slipped out the door. The air was humid. Chirping frogs. Warbling crickets. Power lines humming above the street. Still thinking about the lyrics for the new verse, he walked back toward the club where the van was parked. Shards of glass shimmered on the sidewalk. Traffic lights were glowing along the boulevard ahead. Emerald. Topaz. Ruby. Approaching an intersection, he heard the snarl of a dog, and as he glanced back a pitbull leapt at him, knocking him to the pavement, snapping at him, barking at him, and then as a voice shouted the pitbull galloped away. Footsteps nearby. Swearing. Lying there in the street, gasping, trembling, breathing, he became aware of a throbbing pain. He bled to death in the gutter, too shocked to cry.</p>
