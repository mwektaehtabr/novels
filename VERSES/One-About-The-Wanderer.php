      <p>He flew back across the ocean with her the next morning. Bought a house in the woods. Worked for forty-three years as a carpenter. Had five kids and six grandkids and a reputation for always smiling. Lived through a bomb threat at a post office, a catastrophic flood, a cataclysmic blizzard, a head-on collision with a delivery truck, an armed robbery in a parking lot, the death of both parents, a power outage during a subzero cold wave, surgery for a brain tumor, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, widowhood, pneumonia, an air leak aboard the space station, islands vanishing under the rising sea, a world at war over water. Crept through the barbed wire and the concrete barricades and the muddy craters of earth in a minefield, buttoned into a dusty jacket, gripping an empty canteen. Stepped over a charred belt on the ground, then got blasted backward in an explosion of dirt and pebbles. Lay breathing in a puddle of blood, gazing up at the sky. Died happy.</p>
