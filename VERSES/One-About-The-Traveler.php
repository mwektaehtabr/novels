      <p>He flew back across the ocean with her the next morning. Bought a house in the woods. Worked for thirty-five years as a carpenter. Had four kids and seven grandkids and a reputation for always smiling. Lived through a mass shooting at a supermarket, a catastrophic blizzard, a cataclysmic drought, a carjacking in a parking garage, bronchitis, the sudden death of both parents, a global pandemic, surgery for a brain tumor, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, bankruptcy, widowhood, cardiac arrest in a puddle of detergent on the floor of a laundromat in a strip mall, cyberattacks on the stock market, the suicide of a president, a meteor strike on the space station, islands vanishing under the rising ocean, a world at war over water. Trekked with a band of refugees across a frosted meadow, hands bound with grimy bandages, feet wrapped with bloody rags, draped with a ripped fleece. Collapsed into the grass. Lay breathing on the dirt, gazing up at the sky. Died happy.</p>
