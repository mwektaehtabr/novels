Had four kids and seven grandkids and a reputation for always smiling. Lived through a terrorist attack at a supermarket, a catastrophic blizzard, a cataclysmic wildfire, a carjacking in a parking garage, a cloud of toxic fumes from a derailed freight train, a flu epidemic, the death of both parents, melanoma, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, bankruptcy, widowhood, botulism, mass suicides aboard the space station, islands vanishing under the rising sea, a world at war over water. Crept through the barbed wire and the concrete barricades and the scorched craters of earth in a minefield, zipped into a tattered parka, gripping an empty canteen. Stepped over a mildewed blanket on the ground, then got blasted backward in an explosion of dirt and pebbles. Lay breathing in a puddle of blood, gazing up at the sky. Died happy.</p>
