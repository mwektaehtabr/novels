and later that year the child was born, in a busy urban hospital on the rainy autumn morning of November 6, 1985. If he&rsquo;d been a girl, his parents would have named him Megan, but instead his parents named him William.</p>
        <p>By the time he entered kindergarten he&rsquo;d begun to understand that he was different somehow from other children. William had wide brown eyes, slender arms, delicate hands, and a gap in his teeth, with wild dark hair that his mother trimmed with kitchen shears on a stool out on the stoop once a month, and a faint birthmark on his thigh that embarrassed him. He was enchanted by patterns and symmetry and repetition, especially sequences of numbers, and was already reading, but though he had a natural aptitude for written language, he was shy and awkward and had difficulty communicating aloud. At home his parents were patient, encouraging him to speak, listening with interest whenever he falteringly told a story, laughing with pleasure whenever he hesitantly made a joke, but at school he was quiet, overwhelmed by the constant chatter of the other children, the rapid shifts in topic and tone, and on the rare occasions when he did dare try to speak the other children immediately interrupted him or just stared at him like he was a freak. He seemed to be oblivious to certain social conventions that were obvious to the rest of human society. Gender norms, for instance. William liked to go shopping for groceries at the supermarket with his mother, and once he noticed a display of mini backpacks for sale, but when he told his mother that he wanted one, his mother seemed embarrassed, firmly explaining to him that mini backpacks were only for girls. Afterward, trailing his mother through the aisles of the supermarket, he felt ashamed, as if he had disappointed his mother somehow. He&rsquo;d noticed other children at school wearing mini backpacks, and he&rsquo;d liked how the mini backpacks looked, but he&rsquo;d failed to notice that every person who wore a mini backpack was a girl. He failed to notice that only girls chose pink until he got mocked for selecting a pink popsicle for his snack. He failed to notice that only girls picked flowers until he got mocked for sticking a plucked flower in his hair. For some reason he just didn&rsquo;t naturally categorize other people by gender. He was often bullied at school. He lived in rural Michigan, on a meandering dead-end road with wooden farm stands that offered corn and berries and bundles of firewood depending on the season, in a modest one-story house with painted shutters and a massive oak tree in the yard. William loved to be home, just him and his parents. His mother worked as a nurse and liked to draw hopscotch courses with him out in the driveway. His father worked as a cop and liked to birdwatch with him with binoculars out on the deck. When his parents were busy doing housework or yardwork, he liked to play alone out in the woods, or to read books on the couch in the living room, snuggled under a blanket. In the novels that he read, the hero always had a destiny, overcoming some adversary or misfortune in order to fulfill a great purpose, and lying there on the couch sometimes he would glance away from the book, looking out toward the road, wondering what he was destined for, if he had a destiny too.</p>
        <p>One weekend while taking a walk down the road he and his parents happened to come upon a garage sale, and he and his parents wandered through the garage sale together for a while, inspecting the seemingly random assortment of objects there. Antique furniture, vintage appliances, a vegetarian cookbook, a computer monitor, forgotten pop albums on cassette tape. Jumbled mounds of clothing, some smelling faintly musty, others scented with detergent. Neon fanny packs. Fluorescent beach chairs. A brass orrery with gemstone planets. While his parents murmured over a tub of faded postcards, he drifted toward the back of the garage sale, where in the glittering particles of dust floating through the sunlight stood an old upright piano affixed with a bright price tag. He stared at the piano, hesitating for a moment, and then on an impulse he pressed down one of the keys, producing a hollow tinny tone that wavered through the air before fading into silence. Hearing the sound, the elderly neighbor who was running the garage sale shuffled over to him, looming over him with a scowl, and he felt a jolt of panic, afraid that she was angry at him for touching the piano, but instead of scolding him she reached out with trembling fingers and took ahold of his hand and carefully molded his hand into a peculiar shape, raising some fingers and spreading other fingers apart, and then she placed his hand onto the keys of the piano at a certain position and nodded at him to press down again, and that time a group of tones rang out simultaneously, a pleasant chord. Realizing that playing a piano was that simple, just making a hand into different shapes, he broke out into a smile, and the elderly neighbor grinned, delighted by how happy he was. When his parents walked over, the elderly neighbor asked if his parents were interested in buying the piano, and his parents laughed in embarrassment, glancing at the price tag, explaining that his family couldn&rsquo;t afford to, but then the elderly neighbor scowled again and shook her head and peeled the price tag off the piano and then offered the piano to his parents for a single dollar. All that she wanted, she said, was for the piano to go to a home where the piano would be played again. Looking stunned, his parents tried to reject the offer, but the elderly neighbor insisted, and eventually his parents agreed to accept, thanking the elderly neighbor profusely, seeming overwhelmed by the generosity. His father jogged off down the road and drove back with the pickup, and by dusk the piano was standing against a wall in the living room, topped with a vase of dried wildflowers. William was amazed by the instrument. For a week whenever he walked past the piano he would play the chord that the elderly neighbor had taught him, that same group of tones, and then his parents finally found a recommendation for a piano teacher through a friend of a coworker and signed him up for lessons.</p>
        <p>The piano teacher lived alone in a weathered old house out by a pond. Lauren was middle-aged, humble and timid with a gentle voice and a neatly trimmed beard, and wore cotton shirts tucked into faded khakis with plain leather loafers. Every object in the house was simple and worn. The only exception stood in the living room: a majestic grand piano with a body so polished that light shimmered off the surface, reflecting the surroundings like a mirror. Each key possessed a tremendous resistance to being pressed and when plunked produced a glorious resonant tone that would ring through the air with breathtaking power, perfectly tuned. William marveled at the sound. During lessons, Lauren would sit next to him on the piano bench, observing and instructing and turning the pages of a songbook for him while his mother waited on a chair over in the corner, flipping through a novel or a magazine. In warmer months, with the windows open for the breeze, the music had a smoother sound, blending with the chirping of finches and cardinals in the branches of the maples in the yard and the distant croaking of bullfrogs out by the pond. In colder months, with the windows shut against the chill, the music had a harsher sound, reverberating through the silent rooms of the house, accompanied only by the occasional creak of the roof in a gust of wind. After a year of lessons, William began to experiment with writing sheet music, carefully drawing the lines of a staff onto a scrap of paper and then marking in a melody. Notes and rests, sharps and flats. He wrote a couple of simple songs, and then one evening while his parents were canning strawberries and rain was drizzling out the windows he began working on a song that was much longer and more complex, variations on a melody that had come to him in a dream, a sequence of tones that didn’t exactly sound cheerful or sad but instead seemed to contain a sense of fearful wonder, like the feeling that he got when he looked up at the stars at night and thought about other planets. He had a vague sense of the form that the song should take, but the song in his mind was difficult to capture on the page. He struggled, scratching out passages, scribbling over passages, throwing away crumpled sheets of paper. Months passed, a robin laid eggs in a nest in the crook of the branches of the oak in the yard and the chicks hatched and grew feathers and flew away, dandelions flowered and grew seeds that blew away in the wind, and he still wasn’t happy with the beginning of the song, and he still hadn’t found an ending for the song either.</p>
        <p>One week the piano teacher asked his mother to stay for a moment after the lesson. Although the weather that day was sunny, a powerful wind was blowing, and the piano teacher had been forced to shut all of the windows during the lesson to prevent the breeze from flipping the pages of the songbook, and even now that the windows were shut the glass was rattling in the frames. Standing there at the door, speaking in a solemn tone, the piano teacher announced that there was something he needed to say. William simply was not like the other students. Lauren was amazed how effortlessly he could sight-read music. How quickly he could identify chords, could calculate the combined duration of joined notes and rests, could compute the resulting pitch of compounded flats and sharps, transpose to a different key. How nimbly he could maneuver through complex passages across the keyboard, instinctually crossing his fingers and even his arms when necessary. How gracefully he could depress and ease up off the pedals, sustaining or damping with a light touch of his foot. How much emotion he could express through changes in volume, bursts of staccato and ripples of legato, a fermata held until some exact moment in time. William was the most gifted student he&rsquo;d ever taught, Lauren said. If he kept with it, continued to practice and to perform and to learn, there was no doubt that he could play piano professionally someday, maybe with a symphony, or in a band.</p>
        <p>William stood gazing up at him with a sense of fear.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have the potential to make a life out of this,&rdquo; Lauren said.</p>
