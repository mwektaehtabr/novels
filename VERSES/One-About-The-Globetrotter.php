      <p>He flew back across the ocean with her the next morning. Bought a house in the woods. Worked for fifty-nine years as a carpenter. Had four kids and three grandkids and a reputation for always smiling. Lived through a random stabbing at a pharmacy, a catastrophic blizzard, a cataclysmic earthquake, the sudden death of both parents, a rollover car wreck on a foggy highway, a high-voltage electrocution from a fallen power line, a global pandemic, cardiac arrest in a restroom at a supermarket, a brain tumor, widowhood, diabetes, the suicide of a president, cyberattacks on the stock market, an electrical fire aboard the space station, islands vanishing under the rising sea, a world at war over water. Crept through the barbed wire and the concrete barricades and the scorched craters of earth in a minefield, zipped into a grimy fleece, gripping an empty canteen. Stepped over a moldy towel on the ground, then got blasted backward in an explosion of dirt and pebbles. Lay breathing in a puddle of blood, gazing up at the sky. Died happy.</p>
