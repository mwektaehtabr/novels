Lived through a terrorist attack at a supermarket, a catastrophic blizzard, a cataclysmic drought, the sudden death of both parents, a mugging in a shopping mall, a global pandemic, surgery for a brain tumor, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, bankruptcy, widowhood, meningitis, cardiac arrest in a puddle of soda on the pavement in the parking lot of a pawnbroker, the collapse of the stock market, the assassination of a president, mass suicides aboard the space station, islands vanishing under the rising ocean, a world at war over water. Huddled around a cookstove in the ruins of an abandoned pharmacy, hands wrapped with bloody rags, feet bound with dusty bandages, draped with a tattered parka. Heard the crack of artillery, then an explosion. Lay gasping among rubble, looking up at the stars. Died happy.</p>
