      <p>When he was seventeen one night he was wandering a carnival when he was approached by a psychic.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the child of prophecy,&rdquo; the psychic said.</p>
      <p>The psychic was wild-eyed, gazing at him in the yellow-pink glow of the electric lights shimmering across the fairground.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re destined for power,&rdquo; the psychic said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re destined for glory,&rdquo; the psychic said.</p>

He refused to seek out power. He refused to seek out glory. He refused to seek out the gate of the forbidden hexagram, whatever the fuck that was even supposed to mean. Instead he decided to do nothing. Literally nothing. Just live a life of leisure. Unemployed, impoverished, living off welfare and charity and the free meals at soup kitchens. And for sixty-four years that was exactly what he did. He died at the age of eighty-one, bald, bearded, naked aside from some wrinkled boxers, lying alone in bed in an aluminum trailer in a trailer park in the desert, watching the clouds glow violet-orange in the light of the dawn in the sky beyond the window. Clutching at a sudden pain in the chest. Cardiac arrest. When he realized that he was dying he felt a sense of triumph, believing he had conquered destiny at last.</p>
