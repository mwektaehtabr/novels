Turning toward his bed with the book, he could hear the muffled howl of the wind in the yard and the faint murmur of an advertisement on the radio. He lay down on his bed, flipping to the page that he&rsquo;d marked, and then suddenly there was a tremendous explosion.</p>
        <p>He became aware that he was screaming. On reflex he&rsquo;d dropped the book, twisting away from the noise with his arms covering his head and his knees tucked into his chest. When he realized that there was silence again, he tentatively glanced back. A haze of dust was floating through the air. Sunlight was flickering. With a sense of confusion, he saw leaves fluttering across his bedroom. A gnarled trunk spotted with lichen. Acorns were scattered across the carpet. Broken shingles. Smashed plaster. A sparrow flitted onto the roof, looking down at him through a jagged hole in the ceiling. He stared in astonishment, realizing that a tree had fallen onto the house. His parents appeared in the doorway, gasping in shock at the sight of the tree, and then his parents hurried over to him, checking his body for cuts, brushing twigs from his clothes, then hugging him tight.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just so glad you&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; his mother said, kissing his brow.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That was crazy,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>Later his father duct-taped some tarps over all of the furniture in his bedroom, preparing for the roof to be repaired.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So where would you like to sleep until you have a room again?&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>Wrapping an arm around him, she led him around the house, offering him different accommodations. He could sleep on the couch in the living room. On a mat in the closet. On a cot in the basement. He saw that she was enjoying the situation now, grinning playfully. He wondered if she had always been like this. She could adapt to any misfortune in life with a sense of optimism, even humor. He was suddenly bursting with love for her.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Or we can just pitch you a tent in the backyard,&rdquo; his mother said, laughing.</p>
        <p>The idea delighted him.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d actually let me sleep out there?&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>That night his parents assembled a bright orange tent on the dewy grass in the backyard, equipping him with a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag and a walkie-talkie for emergencies. A plastic flashlight with a wrist cord. After his parents had said goodnight to him, he lay there alone in the zipped tent. Fireflies drifted past the screen in the door. Over the tart plasticy odor of the nylon fabric of the tent he could smell the fresh sweet aroma of the pine trees and the fir trees and the spruce trees in the woods. The moss. The ferns. He thought about the randomness of life. That he could have died because of some wind. He switched the flashlight on for a moment, moving the beam of the flashlight in loops across the roof of the tent, and then he switched the flashlight off again. Crickets were humming out in the darkness. He thought again about what the piano teacher had said. He loved music, but he also loved math and he also loved science and he also loved language, and he understood that if he wanted to be a professional musician then he would have to begin training for hours every day. Life would be devoted to the pursuit of that dream. Lessons and rehearsals and concerts. He was terrified by the gravity of the decision. That young as he was, he already had the power to choose a career. That when he was older, he might regret the career that had been chosen. That ultimately maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t be happy as a musician. The roof of the tent fluttered with a breeze. He didn&rsquo;t feel ready for so much responsibility. He wasn&rsquo;t ready.</p>
        <p>Eating pancakes with his parents in the morning, he told his parents what he&rsquo;d decided.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to take piano lessons anymore,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>He could see that his parents were disappointed, and for a moment he worried he might be making a mistake.</p>
        <p>For the next decade the piano sat in the living room in silence. He focused on school. On weeknights sat doing homework in the armchair in the living room as his parents chatted over on the couch. Mastered the basics of geometry and algebra and calculus and statistics. Diagrammed atoms. Balanced chemical equations. Analyzed the properties of electric current. Investigated the principles of magnetic flux. Pondered quantum mechanics. Daydreamed about gravity. Sketched imaginary inventions on the flipsides of worksheets. Baked cookies with his mother as his father clipped coupons at the counter. Canned jams with his father as his mother paid bills at the counter. Raked leaves with his parents as squirrels hopped through the grass. Played board games with his parents. Roasted marshmallows over the firepit as his parents pointed at stars. Periodically drove with his parents to the library, bringing home sacks of sci-fi novels, maho anime, budo manga, free-verse poetry, glam albums on compact disc. Watched blockbusters with his parents in the basement, munching on popcorn in the glow of the television. Earned money tutoring reading on the weekends. Once a month one of his parents would squirt the piano with a citrusy cleaning spray, wiping the dust from the wood with a rag.</p>
        <p>When he applied to colleges he got accepted to a prestigious university with an offer for a scholarship that would fund a hundred percent of tuition.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing, kid,&rdquo; his mother said, holding the letter in the kitchen with a look of awe.</p>
        <p>By then he&rsquo;d grown taller than both his parents. Lanky, with wild dark locks of hair that still had only ever been trimmed by his mother. Delicate shoulders. Slender hips. He sat in a pair of wrinkled boxers at the desk in his bedroom, holding the form that he was required to mail back to the university in order to accept the offer. He kept trying to feel happy about going to college, and yet as he stared at the form, what he primarily felt was a sense of angst. The form required him to indicate what he planned to study at the university. What department he planned to join. What degree he planned to earn. He was allowed to say that he was undecided, but he knew that he couldn&rsquo;t be undecided forever. The moment that he stepped onto campus, a countdown would begin. He would have a set amount of time to decide. And when the countdown finally hit zero, what if he still didn&rsquo;t know. Then he would be forced to choose randomly, or just drop out. He tried to imagine having a career. Doctor. Mathematician. Physicist. Astronomer. Geologist. Engineer. Coder. Journalist. Lawyer. Whatever he became would be who he was. That would be the role he played in society. He desperately wanted to become somebody he could be proud of. To contribute something meaningful to humanity. He loved to learn, and he wished he could just study everything, but he understood that if he was going to have any chance of doing something meaningful, he would need to focus. He would need to choose a single occupation. Life would be devoted to the pursuit of that dream. And only after years, or maybe even decades, would he have developed the expertise to actually attempt something meaningful. And what if he failed. And what if he succeeded. What if when he was older he realized that he&rsquo;d chosen too soon. That he would have been happier with some other life. How could he know who he was meant to be if he still didn&rsquo;t even know who he was.</p>
        <p>When he checked the box to indicate that he was undecided, he felt as if he&rsquo;d just admitted to some terrible shortcoming.</p>
        <p>Later that spring he sat alone on a swing at the playground by the library. Scent of thawing snowdrifts. Glimmering puddles of snowmelt. Across the playground the beech trees were already budding. An airplane with multicolored navlights was soaring through the dusk in the sky. He felt utterly infinitesimal. A lone member of a species with a global population of almost eight billion. Born by chance into a particular community with arbitrary customs on a planet that contained staggering cultural diversity. He&rsquo;d never even traveled beyond the borders of the country. Who are you. Who are you meant to be. The beech trees rustled with a breeze.</p>
        <p>He suddenly heard voices.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My cousin did that for a couple of months.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He watched from the swing as a group of figures dressed in hooded jackets shuffled across the cracked pavement of the parking lot.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just backpacking around.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Staying in hostels.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dream.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He recognized the kids from school. Kids he thought of as bullies. Darkness was falling. As the kids approached the playground, he quick rose from the swing, grabbed the satchel of books from the dirt, and slipped off into the beech trees, alone.</p>
        <p>All that he thought about walking home was kaiju and yokai and a seagull that he&rsquo;d seen land on the roof of the library.</p>
        <p>But later that night, sitting at the computer in the basement with a glass of cola, he remembered the conversation that he&rsquo;d overheard. Backpacking, hostels, those were new terms to him. Curious, he searched for some info on the net. Discovered forums devoted to the subject. Enthusiasts. Fanatics. The concept enchanted him. Bunking in a shared room with a bunch of strangers. Showering in a shared bathroom. Cooking in a shared kitchen. Washing laundry in sinks. He&rsquo;d always imagined you had to be rich to travel the world. When he read the daily budget that some backpackers were living on, he was astounded. Some of the backpackers didn&rsquo;t even bother to pay for lodging, just crashing wherever. Chairs in bus terminals. Benches in train stations. Rooftops. Plazas. Verandas. Orchards in the countryside. Camping on beaches for weeks at a time. William laughed in amazement reading about the adventures different backpackers had had. The spectacular mishaps. The serendipitous encounters. Grand sagas of the road.</p>
        <p>That night he lay awake in bed with a pounding heart, contemplating a plan so crazy that he was trembling, astonished that he had the power to make the idea a reality.</p>
        <p>Was it actually possible.</p>
        <p>As he walked across the stage at graduation the principal announced the name of the university he&rsquo;d be attending.</p>
        <p>Eating waffles with his parents later that morning, he told his parents what he&rsquo;d decided.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to go to college this year,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>For a moment his parents were speechless, gazing at him with looks of horror.</p>
        <p>A swing song was playing over the jukebox glowing over by the doors to the diner.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ready yet,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>Distressed, he tried to explain, but his parents interrupted, begging him to reconsider.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have a free ride at a dream institution and you want to throw all of that away just to be some beatnik vagabond?&rdquo; his mother said, sneering with contempt.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bud, not everybody has a brain like you do,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re special,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have so much potential,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have so much promise,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You could be anything,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>He faltered, glancing down at the table.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know who to be,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>He felt a rising sense of shame.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I need some time,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>Driving home through a rainstorm later that afternoon, sitting in the backseat of the sedan, he suddenly felt the sedan glide to a halt, and glancing up through the windshield he saw that a gigantic sycamore tree had toppled across the road ahead, blocking a lane, and for a moment he stared at the tree with his parents in silence as rain pattered the roof of the sedan, and then the sedan maneuvered around the tree to continue on down the road.</p>
        <p>Later that summer he snapped a rubber band around the wad of money he&rsquo;d saved from tutoring, a couple grand in total, stuffing the cash into a backpack along with a toothbrush, a flashlight, a wristwatch, a compass, a pocketknife with a corkscrew, a jumble of clothing.</p>
        <p>He bought a one-way ticket at the airport.</p>
        <p>His parents sat with him at the gate.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do if you run out of money,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I guess get a job for a while,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>Mist was trickling down the windows.</p>
        <p>Fog was drifting across the runway.</p>
        <p>A jet taxied toward the terminal.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you mad at me for not going to college this year,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>He hesitated for a moment, feeling afraid.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I mean, do you hate me,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>He glanced over at his parents, and thinking suddenly of the framed photograph on the fireplace back at home, the snapshot of his parents cradling him as a baby, he became aware of how much his parents had aged since that day, and that he might never see his parents again if he stepped onto the plane.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll always love you, sweetie,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>Tears were shimmering in her eyes.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We just want you to be happy,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>His mother plucked a tissue from a purse.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Truly that&rsquo;s all we want for you,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>The speakers crackled.</p>
        <p>An attendant announced the flight was boarding.</p>
        <p>His parents hugged him as other passengers began streaming toward the gate.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You swear we&rsquo;ll hear from you at least once a week?&rdquo; his father said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please be safe,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And have fun,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
        <p>When he glanced back at the gate, he saw that even though his parents were crying his parents also were beaming with what looked like pride.</p>

Dropped acid at a bonfire in a jungle in Maharlika, hallucinated a shimmering nightmare in otherworldly colors, and woke in the surf on a beach in the faint indigo light before daybreak, shocked back awake by the foaming water rushing onto the shore around him where he lay with the limbs of a stranger draped across his chest. After a decade of wandering he&rsquo;d traveled to nearly every country on the planet. By then every belonging that he&rsquo;d brought from home had been lost or destroyed or stolen or gifted to a fellow explorer. He drifted between hostels in a faded t-shirt and jean cutoffs, wearing leather hiking boots that he&rsquo;d found abandoned at an oasis in a desert, carrying a fluorescent backpack that he&rsquo;d found abandoned in a glade in a forest, his hair in a topknot, his jaw glittering with stubble, his skin tanned a dark shade of bronze, with a pale jagged scar across his shin from a swim through a coral reef. Emailed his parents from nethubs, and sent postcards to his parents, and called his parents from payphones. Thought sometimes about destiny. He loved to travel. He&rsquo;d experienced so many moments of joy and excitement and fascination and wonder on the road. And yet in all of that time he had never felt truly happy. Instead what he had felt was a profound sense of emptiness. Emptiness, that had been the one constant feeling, haunting him wherever he went. He had no purpose. No craft. No vocation. All of that time, and he still didn&rsquo;t know what he was supposed to be, and at a certain point he&rsquo;d had to admit that maybe he was afraid to. He was afraid to commit to any one path. He&rsquo;d been avoiding the choice for decades. And why. Why was he so afraid of choosing. Of pursuing a dream. Was he afraid of failing. Was he afraid of succeeding. Why did the idea of having to commit to a path seem so tragic to him.</p>
        <p>One night, sitting alone in a karaoke bar in Tokyo, he noticed somebody wearing a sequined jacket that glittered under the glow of the neon lights. She was short and scrawny, with thick wavy hair dyed a violet-pink ombre. Brown eyes darkened with shadow. Snub nose. Plump cheeks. Black polish on her fingernails. After hanging back by the speakers for a while, she stepped onto the stage, gripping the microphone so tight her knuckles turned white, briefly closing her eyes, opening her eyes again, taking a breath, and then belting out the lyrics to an obscure soul song, swaying in rhythm with the beat. Her voice was spellbinding. Seemed to contain infinite heartbreak. When she hit the refrain he became aware that his heart was pounding.</p>
        <p>Afterward she approached him.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That was so terrible,&rdquo; she said, laughing with a look of embarrassment.</p>
        <p>She had a goofy smile. She spoke with a lisp. As random figures stood in the darkness by the screen, crooning lyrics into the microphone, she sipped on a glass of champagne, rambling about her life. She was twenty-eight, born in Kansas, raised in Missouri. Worked at a library. Secretly she&rsquo;d always dreamed of becoming a musician, she&rsquo;d actually even recorded a couple of tracks, but after what had happened to her sister she&rsquo;d needed a career with stability. Her songs had probably been horrible anyway. Nerdwave. Geekcore. She was such an otaku. She was so excited to be in Edo, she&rsquo;d literally wept when she&rsquo;d stepped off the plane. This was the only vacation she&rsquo;d ever taken. She&rsquo;d timed the trip for hanami. Drank some matcha at a teahouse on an island in a garden, wrote a wish onto an ema tablet at a shrine, selected a fortune from an omikuji box at a temple, spied on some sumos in a stable, wandered awestruck through a department store, binged a package of chestnut wagashi, posed for a selfie with a tuna, thrifted for a vintage kimono, scored some cassettes, bagged some vinyl, blew a fortune at an arcade, kissed a statue of a dog. The week had gone in a flash. She had to fly back in the morning. Was probably just going to pull an all-nighter. Lately she&rsquo;d been thinking a lot about quantum superpositions and quantum entanglement and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. She&rsquo;d recently realized that there was something about cats that was suspicious.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s your story,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>Streaks of neon glimmered across the glossy surface of the table.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>He hesitated.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I just travel,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>And after a moment he realized finally that what he did was who he was.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a traveler,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>Hearing about her talk about her dream of becoming a musician had reminded him of playing the piano when he was a child. The unfinished song. He remembered lying awake in the tent in the backyard. The scent of the woods. He looked down at the table, frowning. He was afraid to commit to any one path, which was itself a path. In trying to avoid committing he had committed. He had become a nomad.</p>
        <p>She was talking about the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics again, toying with the empty glass of champagne.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so interesting to me is that, like, scientifically it&rsquo;s impossible to prove. You can&rsquo;t measure something that exists beyond the universe. It&rsquo;s like the existence of god. You can choose to believe or you can choose not to believe. But you can never truly know,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>He glanced at her.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What about you,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What about me,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you believe or do you not believe,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>She frowned, staring at the empty glass of champagne.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I want to believe,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>She suddenly looked profoundly sad.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wonder who we&rsquo;d be in all those other worlds,&rdquo; Janelle said, speaking in only a murmur.</p>
        <p>She eventually drifted off to sleep there at the table with her head in her arms, a strand of hair hanging across her face, her lips slightly parted. A strange mood had come over him. A brooding feeling. Even with all that he&rsquo;d known about quantum mechanics, he&rsquo;d never actually considered the personal implications. He realized now, though, that the theory might be connected to the very questions that had haunted him for decades. Who are you. What is a destiny. Is there a relationship between choice and fate. Is there a relationship between chance and fate. Why do you make the decisions you make. Why are you who you are. As lyrics flashed across the screen in the darkness across the lounge, he sat in the shifting neon glow of the lights, meditating on the nature of reality. He tried to imagine a multiverse of infinite universes. What would become of the self.</p>
        <p>In a multiverse of infinite universes, there would be yous with different names. There would be yous with different birthdates. There would be yous with different birthplaces. There would be yous who spoke different slang, different dialects, different languages. There would be yous who had different personalities, shaped by different experiences. There would be yous with different degrees, different jobs, different politics, different religions. There would be yous with different spouses. There would be yous with different children. But before diverging, each and every one of you would have once been the same organism. At the very least, each and every one of you would have been conceived at the exact same point in spacetime.</p>
        <p>Obviously there would also be universes in which the egg and the sperm that had joined together to form you were instead joined together at a different point in spacetime. But even if you were genetically identical to those other embryos, you would have never been the same organism as those other embryos. Those other embryos wouldn&rsquo;t be you any more than a twin or a triplet would be you. Any more than a clone.</p>
        <p>By that logic, then, he realized that there was only one history that could have produced him. Every event that had occurred before he was conceived was invariable. In every universe in which he existed, on September 3, 1783, Washington had won the American Revolution. In every universe in which he existed, on February 28, 1863, Walt Whitman had composed lines of poetry while tending to the wounded at a hospital. In every universe in which he existed, on June 28, 1874, Emily Dickinson had penned lines of poetry while hiding in a bedroom during a funeral. In every universe in which he existed, on March 17, 1905, Albert Einstein had sat daydreaming about the speed of light in a sunny patent office in Switzerland. In every universe in which he existed, Hiroshima had been obliterated by an atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, Nagasaki had been annihilated by an atomic bomb on August 9, 1945, and in a radio broadcast on August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito had surrendered. In every universe in which he existed, on the balmy windy afternoon of September 9, 1947, Grace Hopper had discovered a moth in the circuitry of a computer in Cambridge. In every universe in which he existed, Elvis Presley had debuted on national television on January 28, 1956, Aretha Franklin had exulted in flower petals onstage on April 28, 1968, Michael Jackson had flaunted a robot dance onstage on November 3, 1973, and on December 16, 1982, Madonna Ciccone had dropped a hit single at a nightclub in Manhattan. In every universe in which he existed, the first international space station had been created by President Reagan, who had formally announced the project to an audience of representatives on the cloudy frigid morning of January 25, 1984.</p>
        <p>Every event that had occurred since he was conceived, however, was variable. A product of the random movements of quantum particles. He tried again to imagine the nature of the self in a multiverse of infinite universes. All of the forms that he would have taken. Ultimately, he realized, whatever he chose to do in this life would be meaningless, not because life was meaningless, but because across the multiverse he would have already lived every possible life. He would have already succeeded in every possible way and he would have already failed in every possible way and he would have already experienced every possible form of pleasure and suffering. Whatever he was in this universe would be merely a single expression of a greater multiversal existence. Imagining that, he was suddenly struck by a sense of serenity so powerful that he felt a shiver of goosebumps down the back of his neck. Blissful contentment. An amor fati, not of eternal recurrence, but of infinite variation. Love of the prismatic self.</p>
        <p>Janelle was awake again, grinning at him with a look of embarrassment, wiping some drool from the corner of her mouth as she lifted her head from her arms.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you wanna go get some fries,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>Rising from the booth, he drifted from the karaoke bar back out into the night, moving through reality in a state of wu wei. Every aspect of the universe suddenly seemed charged with a profound meaning. Glimmering drops of rain dripped from neon signs. Neon ripples shimmered across puddles on the pavement. The chain dangling from a gate was clinking with a breeze. Across the street, an executive in a business suit was marching down the sidewalk gripping a briefcase with a scowl, and at the sight of the executive he was overcome with a sense of love, imagining the executive as merely a single expression of a greater multiversal existence. A sunburned beggar in a bright poncho was counting the coins in a cap on the sidewalk, and at the sight of the beggar he was overcome with a sense of love, imagining the beggar as merely a single expression of a greater multiversal existence. A barista in a corporate uniform was shuffling out a bodega lugging sacks of groceries, and at the sight of the barista he was overcome with a sense of love, imagining the barista as merely a single expression of a greater multiversal existence. A drunk student in a university sweatshirt was shouting profanities at a glowing vending machine, and at the sight of the student he was overcome with a sense of love, imagining the student as merely a single expression of a greater multiversal existence. An elderly patron in a colorful windbreaker stepping through the noren hanging in the doorway of a ramen joint, a neuromantic lolita in a sparkling tinsel wig giggling into a phone, a tourist in a turban flipping through the pages of a guidebook, a biker in a bomber jacket revving a motorcycle before streaking off down the road in a flash of fluorescent light, a skateboarder in a nylon jumpsuit leaning against a railing bleeding from scraped palms, a chauffeur in a sparkling limousine gliding away from the curb with gloved hands gripped tight around the wheel, a cashier in a linen apron daydreaming behind the register of a donut shop, a deliverer in a glinting helmet zipping out of an alley on a moped strapped with boxes of pizza, a busker in a wool beret playing a gleaming saxophone over a velvet-lined case, and then he arrived at a massive intersection where thousands of pedestrians were streaming across the crosswalks in the dazzling radiant light of the electronic billboards above the street, and he stood marveling at the beauty of the chaos, suddenly overcome with love for every person on the planet.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why do you keep smiling like that,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>He was splitting a carton of fries with her, sitting at a counter in the window of a chain restaurant.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I actually achieved a state of enlightenment while you were asleep,&rdquo; William said.</p>
        <p>She reached for some fries, cracking a grin.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Enlightenment, huh,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>Chewing a mouthful of fries, she glanced at him with a mischievous look.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the secret,&rdquo; Janelle said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; William said.</p>
