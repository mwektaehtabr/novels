<p>Back at home his mother got to work preparing dinner, boiling a pot of water for spaghetti, dumping a jar of marinara into a pan, while his father worked on repairing the sink in the bathroom. On the radio in the kitchen a scientist and a priest were arguing about determinism and quantum mechanics. William stood chewing a lip by the counter, thinking about the future, trying to decide what to do. He felt anxious. The wind was blowing so hard that the birdfeeder hanging from the pole in the backyard was tilting sideways. He was hungry and the smell of the store-bought garlic bread heating in the oven made his mouth salivate. He went into his bedroom to read until dinner was ready. The position of the sun was casting the shade of the oak in the yard onto his window. Crouching next to his desk in the dim light, he rooted through his backpack for the book he&rsquo;d recently checked out from the library, a fantasy novel about children traveling through tesseracts to the outer reaches of the universe, until finally beneath some superhero comics at the bottom of his backpack he felt the shape of the book, the ripped cover and the brittle pages of the paperback, and he pulled the book from his backpack, standing up again. Even in there he could smell the garlic bread in the oven. He was ravenous.
