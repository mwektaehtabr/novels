      <p>He flew back across the ocean with her the next morning. Bought a house in the woods. Worked for fifty-one years as a carpenter. Had three kids and seven grandkids and a reputation for always smiling. Lived through a mass shooting at a shopping mall, a catastrophic drought, a cataclysmic blizzard, the sudden death of both parents, a fiery car crash on a rainy highway, sunstroke, cardiac arrest in the parking lot of a post office, melanoma, chemotherapy, widowhood, bronchitis, the impeachment of a president, hostages on the trading floor of the stock exchange, the destruction of the space station, islands vanishing under the rising sea, a world at war over water. Crept through the barbed wire and the concrete barricades and the muddy craters of earth in a minefield, buttoned into a ripped coat, gripping an empty canteen. Stepped over a burned scarf on the ground, then got blasted backward in an explosion of dirt and pebbles. Lay breathing in a puddle of blood, gazing up at the sky. Died happy.</p>
