Had three kids and seven grandkids and a reputation for always smiling. Lived through a mass shooting at a supermarket, a catastrophic blizzard, a cataclysmic drought, armed robbery in a parking garage, the sudden death of both parents, a global pandemic, the assassination of a governor, cardiac arrest in a puddle of urine on the floor of a bathroom in a gas station, a collision with a drunk driver, surgery for a brain tumor, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, bankruptcy, widowhood, pneumonia, the destruction of the space station, islands vanishing under the rising ocean, a world at war over water. Marched through the mountains in a caravan of refugees, hands bound with dirty bandages, feet wrapped with bloody rags, draped with a threadbare cloak. Collapsed onto the rocks. Lay breathing in the dirt, gazing up at the sky. Died happy.</p>
