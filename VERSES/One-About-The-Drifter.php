Had three kids and five grandkids and a reputation for always smiling. Lived through a mass shooting at a pharmacy, a catastrophic wildfire, a cataclysmic blizzard, a high-speed collision with a jackknifed semitruck on a rainy highway, an outbreak of tornadoes, the death of both parents, a brain tumor, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, widowhood, diabetes, the suicide of a president, hostages on the trading floor of the stock exchange, a meteor strike on the space station, islands vanishing under the rising sea, a world at war over water. Crouched over a cookstove in the ruins of an abandoned library, zipped into a ripped fleece, stirring a pot of beans with a wooden spoon. Heard the pop of a rifle, then an explosion. Lay gasping among the rubble, looking up at the stars. Died happy.</p>
