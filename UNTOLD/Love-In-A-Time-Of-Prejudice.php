        <p><a href="Theodores-Disposition">She&rsquo;d realized how he felt</a> not at once, but rather gradually. A growing awareness of a hidden connection between seemingly meaningless incidents. How he&rsquo;d blushed when a cute porter had complimented his eyes, helping him carry a suitcase. How he&rsquo;d tittered when a handsome coachy had helped him aboard a carriage, grasping his hand. How flustered he&rsquo;d become in the presence of a shirtless bricklayer whose hairy muscular chest was gleaming with sweat. How dramatically the pitch of his voice had changed, had become almost flirtatious, when a mustachioed bartender cologned with a musky scent had offered him a goblet of port gratis.</p>
        <p>Finally, painting with him one day along the shore of an indigo-pink salt lake in the desert, she noticed that when a trio of nude bathers emerged from the water, he stared at the figure who was male instead of the figures who were female.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Theodore,&rdquo; Clara said.</p>
        <p>He grunted, glancing from the bathers down toward the palette, dabbing the paintbrush in a blotch of violet.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Have you ever been in love before?&rdquo; Clara said.</p>
        <p>The bathers chatted together, gathering clothing from the sand.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Many times,&rdquo; Theodore said.</p>
        <p>The bathers were buttoning on trousers, twisting a ribbon, clasping on a dress.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And you have been loved in return?&rdquo; Clara said.</p>
        <p>The bathers were grabbing a necktie, tying a bonnet, buttoning on a shirt.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;On occasion,&rdquo; Theodore said.</p>
        <p>The bathers strolled off down the beach, laughing together.</p>
        <p>He touched a stroke of paint to the canvas.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo; Theodore said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just happy for you,&rdquo; Clara said.</p>
