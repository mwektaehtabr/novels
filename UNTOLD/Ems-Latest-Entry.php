        <p>been thinking about grams, about how at night when she would tell me a story as she was putting me to bed, she would always create these super imaginative plotlines, like about a kid discovering some buried treasure, or like a kid becoming a secret agent, but the plots would get so complicated that she&rsquo;d never have time to finish, and so eventually when she was too tired to keep going she would just abruptly end the story by saying, &ldquo;and then they woke up, and it had all been a dream,&rdquo; with the most <u>devious</u> smile — which was always so frustrating! — but now that i'm older i wonder if maybe there was some deeper truth to those stories after all — like for example, if this universe actually <u>is</u> only a simulation like that philosopher was saying, if none of this is real, then all along every life in human history ultimately <u>was</u> only a dream?</p>
