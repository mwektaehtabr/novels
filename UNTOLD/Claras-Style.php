        <p><a href="The-Paintings">Once,</a> noticing her painting <a href="Theodores-Whereabouts">alone at an easel on a rocky shore along the ocean,</a> an artist lodging at the same hotel approached her on the beach, standing there scrutinizing her painting for a while in silence.</p>
        <p>She could sense him looming behind her as she dabbed paint onto the canvas.</p>
        <p>She was about to remark on how beautiful the weather was when he suddenly spoke.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I must tell you, you have utterly failed to capture the appearance of the scene,&rdquo; <a href="Edgar">Edgar</a> said.</p>
        <p>Her hand froze, still gripping the paintbrush.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is, to be frank, a certain childishness in the attempt,&rdquo; Edgar said.</p>
        <p>Tears shimmered in her eyes.</p>
        <p>She was almost too humiliated to respond.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; Clara said, faltering.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; Edgar said.</p>
        <p>She reached up to wipe the tears from her eyes with the back of a wrist.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to paint how the scene feels to me, not how the scene looks,&rdquo; Clara said.</p>
